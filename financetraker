💰 Personal Finance Tracker – Python Project

The Personal Finance Tracker is a beginner-friendly Python project that helps users keep track of their personal finances by recording income and expenses in a structured manner. The application assists users in monitoring day-to-day spending, evaluating financial habits, and identifying high-value transactions — all through a simple terminal-based interface.

The system stores each transaction as a dictionary containing details such as amount, type (income/expense), description, and date. These dictionaries are then maintained as a list, making it easy for users to perform actions like adding new entries, viewing full transaction history, and filtering based on criteria such as expense size.

This project is ideal for students who are learning about Python basics, data storage using lists/dictionaries, and want to build a meaningful, real-life utility tool using simple logic and clean code organization.

✨ Key Features

➕ Add Income or Expense Records Users can enter an amount, specify whether it is an income or an expense, and provide a brief description.

📊 View Full Transaction History Displays all previously added transactions with details, helping users review how money is being earned and spent.
